            <h2>What is grass-fed beef?</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Grass-fed beef is when the cattle are grazed on grassy pastures their entire lives.
                    This results in a much healthier, and better tasting meat.
                    When it comes to nutrition, grass-fed beef is higher in key nutrients, including antioxidants and vitamins.
                    Grass-fed beef also has less intramuscular fat, so it tends to be meatier than corn-fed,
                    and tends to cook faster as well.</p>

            <h2>What is the process of meat processing?</h2>
            <div>
                <p>After the cow is taken to the processing plant, they will begin the process of creating beef for consumption.
                    They begin by examining the animal to make sure it is fit for human consumption.
                    After the cow checks out, it will then be slaughtered most likely using a stunning device.
                    The cow is then skinned and sprayed down with water to remove excess blood and bone chips.
                    The beef is then tagged and hung in a large cooler for over a week to age.
                    Aging the beef will improve its flavor, and make it more tender.
                    Finally, the beef is cut according to the end beef products and is sent to stores around the world.</p>

            <h2>What is rotational grazing?</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Rotational grazing is a practice of moving animals through pasture to improve soil and plant health.
                    Only one section of the pasture is grazed at a time, while the remainder of it rests.
                    Grazing pastures allows plants to recover and deepen their root systems.</p>
